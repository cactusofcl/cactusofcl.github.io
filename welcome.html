        <h3>Welcome to NKS's Website!</h3>
        <p>Aug 30, 2023</p>
        <p>We built a webpage so you can have easier access to updates and list of projects we have going on. We hope you find this website useful as we put a lot of time in mainly setting it up to be on the web.</p>
        <p>Finland Studios is our current project. Although not actually based in Finland, this is the name we chose due to how great of a country Finland is. We will mainly be focusing on Godot and Unity game development, which is the same concept of our film project, but we can make games instead since it is much easier, saves time, and everyone can still have a part in our games.</p>
        <p>We know we failed many times in the past trying to get recognized and rebranded the server because of it. However, this is our first time rebranding the server to serve a new purpose and to share our games out into the internet without worrying about if we will succeed or not, because that will come with time.</p>
        <p>Our first game is going to be Time Bomb, which is a fast paced game where players pass a bomb to each other and wait till it explodes, similar to hot potato. Each map has different spins like weather, sprite changes, visibility, and much more to come. You can also find occassional power ups around the map, which give you a small advantage in getting away from the bomb as much as possible.</p>
        <p>Check out the Time Bomb repository on GitHub to see where we stand in terms of progress and staying updated by following our announcements channel in the Discord. For any games that release, please report bugs, suggestions, and complaints inside our Discord server, we will have dedicated channels for each game. If you have questions in terms of what you can contribute and how you can contribute, check out the dedicated FAQ page. Have fun suggesting amazing game ideas, we are excited to see what you have in mind!</p>
